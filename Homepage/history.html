        <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
        <p>
            Indoneasia was first settled over 2,000 years ago by ancient seafarers 
            who navigated the Emerald Ocean. Small kingdoms formed along the fertile coasts.
        </p>

        <h2>The Golden Age</h2>
        <p>
            Between the 12th and 16th centuries, Indoneasia became a center of trade, 
            culture, and religious development. Massive temples and ocean palaces 
            were built during this time.
        </p>

        <h2>Modern Era</h2>
        <p>
            In 1947, Indoneasia became an independent island nation known for stability, 
            peace, and cultural preservation.
