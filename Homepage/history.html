        <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
        <p>
            Human presence in Indonesia dates back over a million years, with fossils such as 
            Homo erectus (“Java Man”) providing evidence of early settlement. 
            By around 2000 BCE, Austronesian-speaking peoples migrated from Taiwan and established 
            coastal communities, bringing advanced boat-building and agriculture.
        </p>

        <h2>Rise of Kingdoms</h2>
        <p>
            Between the 4th and 15th centuries, Indonesia saw the rise of powerful kingdoms such as 
            Srivijaya (a maritime empire controlling trade routes) and 
            Majapahit, known as one of the greatest empires in Southeast Asian history. 
            Trade with China, India, and the Middle East greatly influenced religion, art, and architecture.
        </p>

        <h2>Colonial Era</h2>
        <p>
            From the 16th century onward, European powers—starting with the Portuguese and later the Dutch—
            sought control over the spice trade. Indonesia became part of the Dutch East Indies, enduring 
            centuries of colonial rule, forced labor, and resource exploitation.
        </p>

        <h2>The Road to Independence</h2>
        <p>
            After Japanese occupation during World War II, Indonesian nationalists declared independence 
            on August 17, 1945. Following years of conflict, sovereignty was officially recognized 
            in 1949. Indonesia has since grown into one of the world’s largest democracies.
        </p>

        <h2>Modern Indonesia</h2>
        <p>
            Today, Indonesia is known for its cultural diversity, rapid economic growth, rich ecosystems, 
            and influential role in Southeast Asia. It is home to over 17,000 islands and more than 
            300 ethnic groups, making it one of the most diverse countries in the world.
